**Test:**

- nx run-many --target=test --parallel=4 / 26m 9s
- ðŸš… nx run-many --target=test --parallel=8 --maxWorkers=4 / 23m 34s
- nx run-many --target=test --parallel=8 --maxWorkers=2 / 25m 34s
- nx run-many --target=test --parallel=8 --maxWorkers=4 && v9 jest has maxWorkers=4 / 29m 11s
- nx run-many --target=test --parallel=8 --maxWorkers=4 && v9 jest has maxWorkers=4 && ts-jest isolatedModules / 31m 56s

  - this doesn't make any sense, the test time should have been the same as the fastest or even faster (23m)

- lage test / (constantly fails on ssr-test (TimeoutError: Navigation timeout of 10000 ms exceeded)
  )
  - 27m 5s
  - 33m 50s

### react-components

~~All packages use native jest so no perf bottlenecks caused by test execution. âœ…~~

ðŸ”¥ v9 packages are not using maxWorkers which might cause OOM and other issues on CI !!!!

- fixed by setting maxWorkers on CI

### react

- used `runInBand` on CI !!!!! (update: without that it will never finish because memory leaks, we will use maxThreadWorkers=4)

**Tests contain memory leaks**

> discovered on CI when pipeline was executed via nx:

```
worker process has failed to exit gracefully and has been force exited. This is likely caused by tests leaking due to improper teardown. Try running with --detectOpenHandles to find leaks. Active timers can also cause this, ensure that .unref() was called on them.
